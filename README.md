## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is **Pathri Vidya Praveen** ,**a passionate programmer and a tech enthusiast**, a B.Tech CSE Student in IIT Hyderabad. I like to explore many things starting from Data Structures and Algorithms, Mathematics to AI ML and WebDev stuff. 
I also like to understand everything deeply and clearly about how are things working on actually deep inside and how are things built actually from a developer's POV.

Currently exploring various things like **DSA and Competitive Programming , Machine Learning and Web Development** dedicating some time to each topic alongside academics and interested to look into Low level System Programming in future.


My Projects :

1) Spam Email Classifier using Logistic Regression Model and NLP Techniques like Stopwords removal and TF-IDF Vectorization
2) Built few ML algorithms from scratch like KNN classifier , Decision Tree, K-Means Clustering.
3) Built a MERN Stack Web Application for Mess registration App Backend .
4) Built a Deep Learning Model that predicts the emotion of given audio clip from RAVDESS dataset using multimodal emotion recognition from audio and transcripts
