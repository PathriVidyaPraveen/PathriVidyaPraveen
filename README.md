## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is **Pathri Vidya Praveen** ,**a passionate programmer and a tech enthusiast, a B.Tech CSE Student in IIT Hyderabad. I like to explore many things starting from Data Structures and Algorithms, Mathematics to AI ML stuff. 
I also like to understand everything deeply and clearly about how are things working on actually deep inside and how are things built actually from a developer's POV.

Currently exploring various things like **DSA and Competitive Programming , Machine Learning and Web Development** dedicating some time to each topic alongside academics and interested to look into Low level System Programming and Cybersecurity in future.

**Current Working Project:
Trying to build a 2D Game Engine in C++ using various Object Oriented Programming Concepts and using SDL2 API.**

My Projects :
